Variable Scope/Types
==========================
1.Local Variable:
------------------
Any variable declare inside method/block is called local variable

scope: within method 
Memory allocate: At the time of execution of method
Memory deallocate: After method execution

2.Instance variable
---------------------------
any variable declare inside the class outside the method/block 
is called instance variable

Scope: Within Object
Memory allocation: At the time of Object creation
Memory deallocation: After Object execution
note: Instance variable will get the new memory once you create new Object
To call instance data we need Object

3.static variable
------------------------
any variable declare inside the class outside the method/block 
with static keyword is called static variable

Scope: Within Class

To call static data we don't need any object
note:static variable shares common memory with all objects

Wrapper class remaining!
