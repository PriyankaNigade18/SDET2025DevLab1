Variable Scope/Types
==========================
1.Local Variable:
------------------
Any variable declare inside method/block is called local variable

scope: within method 
Memory allocate: At the time of execution of method
Memory deallocate: After method execution

2.Instance variable
---------------------------
any variable declare inside the class outside the method/block 
is called instance variable

Scope: Within Object
Memory allocation: At the time of Object creation
Memory deallocation: After Object execution
note: Instance variable will get the new memory once you create new Object
To call instance data we need Object

3.static variable
------------------------
any variable declare inside the class outside the method/block 
with static keyword is called static variable

Scope: Within Class
Memory allocation: At the time of class loading
Memory deallocation: After class unloaded

To call static data we don't need any object
note:static variable shares common memory with all objects

Wrapper class remaining!

Static Block
=================
Static block is used to initialize static variable
Static block is having first priority

this keyword
================
1.this keyword help you to differentiate local and instance variable
2.this help to call method
3.this help to call any constructor
4.this is used to return current instance from method-Builder pattern


==================================================
Loop
=================
for loop:
Number of iterations are known

Scenarios:
=============
- Automation Menu/dropdown
- Calendar(days 30,31,28,29)


while loop
===================
entry control loop
number of iterations are not known/unknown

Scenarios:
=================
- list with dynamic count of elements
- pegination(dynamic pages)

do-while loop
==============
exit control loop
one time executing


one time we are expecting result without matter what condition it is
