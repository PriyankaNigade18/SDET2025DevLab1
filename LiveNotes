Variable Scope/Types
==========================
1.Local Variable:
------------------
Any variable declare inside method/block is called local variable

scope: within method 
Memory allocate: At the time of execution of method
Memory deallocate: After method execution

2.Instance variable
---------------------------
any variable declare inside the class outside the method/block 
is called instance variable

Scope: Within Object
Memory allocation: At the time of Object creation
Memory deallocation: After Object execution
note: Instance variable will get the new memory once you create new Object
To call instance data we need Object

3.static variable
------------------------
any variable declare inside the class outside the method/block 
with static keyword is called static variable

Scope: Within Class
Memory allocation: At the time of class loading
Memory deallocation: After class unloaded

To call static data we don't need any object
note:static variable shares common memory with all objects

Wrapper class remaining!

Static Block
=================
Static block is used to initialize static variable
Static block is having first priority

this keyword
================
1.this keyword help you to differentiate local and instance variable
2.this help to call method
3.this help to call any constructor
4.this is used to return current instance from method-Builder pattern


==================================================
Loop
=================
for loop:
Number of iterations are known

Scenarios:
=============
- Automation Menu/dropdown
- Calendar(days 30,31,28,29)


while loop
===================
entry control loop
number of iterations are not known/unknown

Scenarios:
=================
- list with dynamic count of elements
- pegination(dynamic pages)

do-while loop
==============
exit control loop
one time executing


one time we are expecting result without matter what condition it is


====================================================
	this Keyword, super keyword & final keyword
	we can use in inheritance

this keyword is used to refer current class variable,method and constructor.

Super Keyword
============================
1.Super keyword can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.
2.Super keyword can be used to invoke immediate parent class method.
3.Super keyword can be used to call immediate parent class constructor.(super())

final Keyword
======================================
final keyword can be apply for variable,method and class
1.If we apply final keyword to variable then that variable will be consider constant variable
(value will become fix...no one can update)
2.If we apply final keyword to method then we cant override that method in other class or child class
3.If we apply final keyword to class then we can not extend that class into another class.
===============================================================
IQ: How we can implement immutable class ,variable or method in java?
Ans: Using final keyword.
==============================================================







Data Abstraction
================
It is process of hiding implementation details of software from end user.

Abstraction achive using
------------------------------
1.Abstarct class
2.Interface

1.Abstarct class
===============
1.In abstract class we can have both abstract method and non abstarct (concreate) Methods.
2.Abstract method and class we can declare using abstract keyword.
3.Abstract class can not be instantiated.
4.Abstract methods must be overriden by class which inherits abstract class.
5.Using Abstract class partial abstraction is possible.

Interface
===========
1.An interface in java is a blueprint of a class. 
2.Interface contains final and static variables.
3.Interface contains abstract methods.
4.An abstract method is a method contains definition but not body.
5.Methods in interface are public by default.
6.Interface supports the functionality of multiple inheritance.
7.We can define interface with interface keyword.
8.A class extends another class, an interface extends another interface
 but a class implements an interface.
9.We can create Object reference for Interface but we cannot instantiate interface.
10.Inheritance use extends keyword and Interface use implements keyword.
